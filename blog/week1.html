Diaspora Yatra, a campaign in India to promote diaspora* and to attain self reliance in communication technology, completes its first week today.
</p><p>
‘Yatra’ is a Sanskrit word meaning ‘journey’. Diaspora Yatra, launched by the Indian Pirates with eight partner organizations, has already covered four districts in the Southern Indian state of Kerala. Pirate Praveen, who recently created a <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Diaspora">one step installer for diaspora on debian</a>, is a key player in this campaign engaging in constructive discussions about diaspora with people from all wakes of life.
</p><p>
Diaspora Yatra is turning into a live experiment on what the concepts of freedom, decentralization, and privacy means to different sections of the society.
</p><p>
While the techie adults in Technopark, Trivandrum where the campaign was flagged off were opiniate about security issues in decentralized networks and its trade off with privacy, the young students of Anchal West School, Kollam were more worried about keeping unwanted eyes away from their private affairs.
</p><p>
After being forced to think of how “free” services provided by other social networks are economically feasible for their providers, the teachers at Badhiriya Bachelor of Education Training Centre, Kannanallore were confused whom to trust. But the kids of Mar Baselias school, Kaithakode were receptive and eager.
</p><p>
The working class who were assembled at Government SNDP Higher Secondary School, were quicker to explore diaspora, encryption, and related applications. So were the students of Mar Thoma college, Thiruvalla, Pathanamthitta who also were interested in the legal issues involved in using diaspora. The lawyers of bar association, Alappuzha went a step ahead and talked about whether podmins should scrutinize the content published on their pods and about the jurisdiction of pods.
</p><p>
It must be more than a coincidence that every kind of person has a say about how diaspora* should be, moments after they come to know about it for the first time. Maybe there is an unsatiated craving for freedom and individuality in these minds. And that is exactly the hunger that the <a href="http://yatra.diasporafoundation.org/#team">Diaspora Yatra team</a> intends to sate.
